# Hear Me Out

## Description
You overheard some suspicious people typing on their phones, what are they saying? 

The flag format is gigem{messagewithoutspace}

## Solution

Download the .mp3 and upload it to https://unframework.github.io/dtmf-detect/

The DTMF tones translate to `44422226684433277788`.

I then used https://www.dcode.fr/multitap-abc-cipher to get the flag.  

`Flag: gigem{ICANTHEARU}`
