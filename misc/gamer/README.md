## Description
I was vibing in VC with my gamer friends when I stumbled across a mysterious in-game inscription. Can you figure out what it means?

## Solution
Modify the command to extract the `{Items:...}` NBT data, change the 69 to a 1, and change bat to chest_minecart. Paste it into a command block set to always active and right click the chest minecart that spawns.

Flag: `gigem{mine_diamondz}`
