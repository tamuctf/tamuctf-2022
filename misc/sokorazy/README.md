# Sokorazy

## Description
I know, I know, this is a CTF. It's supposed to be about hacking! But I have something a little different for you.

[Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is a classic example of a puzzle game turned into computer science problem.

I need you to solve 25 levels in less than 10 minutes. Can you do it?

Thank you to Linus Ã…kesson for the use of his level generation algorithm!

## Solution
See `src/solver.rs`.
