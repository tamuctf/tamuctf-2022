## Solution
Looking at the provided picture, it looks like an aircraft carrier that was turned into a tourist attraction, so I googled "aircraft carrier tour coast 16" (the 16 is from the number on the aircraft carrier), and the USS Lexington in Corpus Christi is the first result that pops up. Now that we have the city, I googled "Corpus Christi cybersecurity competition March 31st April 2nd", and the first result that pops up mentions a competition hosted by SkillsUSA.
