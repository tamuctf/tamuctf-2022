## Description
Crack the passwords and get the flag!

This is an automatic reversing challenge. You will be provided an ELF as a hex string. You should analyze the binary, determine the input which makes the binary respond "correct :)", and then respond to the server with your input in the same format. You will need to do this five times within a five minute timeout.
