# Labyrinth

## Description
To get the flag you'll need to get to the end of a maz- five randomly generated mazes within five minutes. 

This is an automatic reversing challenge. You will be provided an ELF as a hex string.  You should analyze it, construct an input to make it terminate with exit(0), and then respond with your input in the same format. You will need to solve five binaries within a five minute timeout. 

## Solution
See `solve.py`.
